# 🎨Edition
Edition is an print collection app designed for printmakers to manage and keep track of their print editions, ink, and paper.

[Edition Deployment](https://edition-app-e049b9671da1.herokuapp.com/)

## 👩🏻‍🎨Description
**Tech Used:** Pyhton, Django, PostgreSQL, CSS, Javascript

**API:** Cloudinary

Managing and keeping track of print editions can get disorganied, especially if you are a printmaker who is always making a new print one after the other. It can be easy to forget edition sizes, the ink and paper used, and it can be easy to forget to document the print created with an image. Edition was designed and created especially for printmakers.

Edition helps manage printmakers editions by allowing them to add all the information about their editions in one place. With Edition, printmakers are able to:

* Add a new edition that includes information like:
  * Edition Name
  * Techniques Used
  * Edition Image
  * Paper and Plate Size
* Add notes to each edition
* Add paper & inks available in your studio
* Archive editions that are no longer available
* Recieve a message when running low on ink or paper

## 🎨 Next Steps

* Add an edition statistics feature to the home page that displays a breakdown of the types of editions, quantity of editions, types of inks, and types of paper available on the account.
* Studio Material Inventory Expenses, a feature that keeps track of monthly expenses accured
* Print Sales, a feature that allows printmakers to keep track of sold artwork
